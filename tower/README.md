# Tower V0

This Pygame + OpenAI Gym environment is a visualization of the construction of a "tower." Here the building blocks are represented in Blue, and the agents in Cyan. The number of blocks an agent is holding is drawn on it. In this setup, the objective is to construct a tower with a height of 5 blocks. Each agent is initialized with 2 blocks.
